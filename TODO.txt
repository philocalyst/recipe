- Fix awkward layout issues and restructure the HTML structure for readability
- Make whatever the default measurement just that category, rather than having "default" as an option...
- Remove the weird "recipes not found at the bottom"
- Fix how the servings refuse to scale.

- Create CSV tables for various name aliases and USDA food codes (and label them according to common foodstore sections).
	- In a perfect world these are also synced to the big food chains sections, so you can dynamically make groccery lists for the groccery store you're visting.
- Create CSV tables for substitutions (could probably be merged into the tables above as well)

- Find a way to link against the governments food directory
- Find a way to link against some site for finding cookware for the cookware
The goal should be to make it as easy as possible to get the required materials

- Add a hover-over for possible subtitutions
- Remove any and all server-client communication where possible.
	I want this to be, as much as possible, a collection of HTML pages. For distribution, this is almost required.
	- Embed conversion data into the actual HTML where it's contained.
	- Keep an alternate stylesheet for dark/light
	- Do scaling calcualations on the JS side
