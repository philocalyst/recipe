Heat the broiler with a rack 6 inches from heat source. Score the @sweet or hot Italian sausage sausages{1%pound} in a few places on both sides, making sure not to cut all the way through. In a #shallow baking dish or baking sheet{}, toss the sausages with the @sweet or mild peppers, seeded and sliced into 2-inch strips if large{1%pound}, @cherry or grape tomatoes{1%pound}, @garlic, peeled and thinly sliced{4%cloves}, @shallots, peeled and cut into 1/2 inch wedges{2}, and @olive oil{3%tbsp}. Season with @salt and @pepper and spread in an even layer.

Broil until the sausage is cooked through and the peppers and tomatoes are nicely charred, ~{10-15%minutes}. Rotate the pan and ingredients as needed so everything gets under the broiler. If everything is charring too quickly, cover the pan with foil. Serve immediately.
