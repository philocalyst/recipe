The recipe format is simply markdown, with a YAML header defining recipe-wide useful attributes. The markdown does need to adhere to a specific set of expectations, but they're few.
- No clarifying substitutions. As the website is built, it'll link agaisnt our substiution database and find this information automatically. If the substitution you were expecting was missing, please submit it to the database.
- If you have any recipe-specifc notes on particular ingridient or step, just create another layer below that step/ingridient, tab, and write-away.
- Each ingridient is defined as: NAME OF INGRIDIENT (FID NUMBER|ANY ATTRIBUTES) - QUANTITY
    For defining quantities of ingridients, please refer to the below table of the abbreviations we employ.
- If a step is meant to take a particular amount of time, please append that duration in parentheses to the step.
- Each dish is stored in a folder with a TitleCase name. The main interpretion of the recipe is named "main", while all others are the name of their variation, like "kosher".

If there is a recipe that you feel is missing, please add it! One note though: any recipe uploaded becomes the communities. We're here to collaborate and improve, not pay respects, so if you would be hurt seeing your recipe being completely changed, this is not the place for you! That being said, if you have a recipe that is similar to an existing one, but has a different perspective (removed ingridients, different method of preperation, etc.), chances are it qualifies to be a variation! This allows us to maintain many very different observations on classic dishes (fancy/cheap, vegan/kosher, etc.). Feel free to submit!
