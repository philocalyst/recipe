 1. Cut pork belly into 2.5-inch pieces and fry until golden. Add ginger, garlic
    cloves, and niboshi and fry until fragrant. Add sake and boil until you
    no longer smell alcohol. Add water, sugar, soy sauce, mirin, star anise,
    black cardamom pod, salt, and return the pork to the pot.  Bring to a simmer
    and then turn down the heat and cover with a tight fitting lid. Cook with
    parchment paper covering in 120 C oven for 3 hours. Strain the braising
    liquid and if you are going to serve it right away, skim off the extra fat.
    It's best if you let this sit in the fridge overnight though as this gives
    the meat a chance to absorb more flavor, and it will make removing the
    excess fat a lot easier.
